# DOS-GUI-Norton-Style
A Norton's Utilities like GUI I developed in Turbo Pascal and Assembly

Comments inside the source code are in Greek Language. So, find the SetGreek.com file to enable the Greek characters and translate them using google translate.

I have also designed a character generator and loadfont application but I really dont remember where the heck I stored the source files.

Just to mention, I designed this DOS User Interface when I was 19 years old !!!
